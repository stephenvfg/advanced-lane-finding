# Description

This repository contains the files for a project from the [Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). The goal of this project was to take a video input stream of a car driving down a highway and to use advanced image processing techniques to identify and highlight the width of the lane on the road while simultaneously calculating the curvature of the road as well as the position of the vehicle in the lane.
